## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android SDK 24 (Android 7.0) or higher
- XAMPP server with PHP and MySQL

### Database Setup
1. Install and start XAMPP
2. Create database:
   - `student_violation_db`
3. Set up your PHP API endpoints (not included in this repository)

### App Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Configure your server IP in the app settings
5. Build and run on device/emulator

## Configuration

### Server Setup

   - Port (default: 8080)

### Database Schema

#### Students Table (Both Databases)
```sql
- id: Primary key
- student_id: Unique student identifier
- name: Full name
- password: Authentication (uses student_id)
- year: Academic year
- course: Course/Strand
- section: Class section
- created_at: Registration timestamp
- image: Profile image path (for image upload/retrieval)
```

#### Violations Table (student_violation_db)
```sql
